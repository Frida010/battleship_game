# Battleship Game

The battleship game is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The user will be able to try to beat the computer by finding the computer's three battleships. The user has ten attempts or as called in the game, ammo. 

The user is rewarded with an extra ammo for each correct hit by the computer's battleship. Each battleship occupies one square on the board. 

## How to play
The battleship game is based on a classic strategy pen-and-paper game which dates back from World War I. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

Guesses are marked on the board whit an - and hits are indicated by an X.
